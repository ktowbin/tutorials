<p>My greatest accomplishment thus far was breaking the UVA 3-meter record last year. Every day since I stepped on grounds, I had starred at the record board in hopes that someday my name would be on it. It was truly really exhilarating to finally do it last winter. </p>

<p> Looking back on it, I was really proud of how I handled each dive. During competition, it is important for me to stay in the present moment and avoid thinking about past or upcoming dives, and I was able to get into my <em> zone </em> and allow my body and mind to work in unison. It was such a fantastic feeling to look at the scoreboard and see all my hard work come to light. </p>

<p> After breaking the record I was contacted by a student who wanted to write an article about my success and share it with the UVA community, I have attached the link below if you would like to learn more about it! </p>
